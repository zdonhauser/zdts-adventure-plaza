              For 18 years, ZDT's Amusement Park was a cherished destination for families across Texas.
              Founded in 2007 by Danny and Sarah Donhauser and named after their three children—Zac,
              Danielle, and Tiffany—the park grew from five indoor attractions to become home to the
              world's first modern wooden shuttle coaster and countless family memories.

              After closing in August 2025, the 10-acre property is being transformed into a vibrant
              entertainment plaza. Multiple buildings and spaces are now available for lease to
              entertainment, tourism, and family-focused businesses that align with our vision of
              creating a dynamic community hub.
