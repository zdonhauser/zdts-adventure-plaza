## Phase 1: Google reCAPTCHA v3 Setup

**Goal:** Register site with Google and obtain reCAPTCHA keys for bot protection

### 1.1 Create/Access Google Account
- [x] Go to https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin
- [x] Sign in with Google account (or create one if needed)
- [x] Accept Terms of Service if prompted

### 1.2 Register Your Site
- [x] Click "+" button to register a new site
- [x] Enter label: `ZDT's Adventure Plaza - Contact Form`
- [x] Select reCAPTCHA type: **reCAPTCHA v3**
- [x] Add domains:
  - [x] `localhost` (for local development)
  - [x] `zdtamusement.com` (production domain)
  - [x] Your Vercel preview domain if applicable (e.g., `*.vercel.app`)
- [x] Accept reCAPTCHA Terms of Service
- [x] Click "Submit"

### 1.3 Save API Keys
- [x] Copy **Site Key** (public key - goes in frontend code)
- [x] Copy **Secret Key** (private key - goes in backend/env only)
- [x] Store keys temporarily in secure location (password manager)

### 1.4 Add Environment Variables
- [x] Create `.env.local` file in project root if it doesn't exist
- [x] Add the following variables:
  ```bash
  # Google reCAPTCHA v3
  NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=your_site_key_here
  RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
  ```
- [x] Verify `.env.local` is in `.gitignore` (should be by default)
- [x] Save the file

### 1.5 Install reCAPTCHA Dependencies
- [x] Run: `yarn add react-google-recaptcha-v3`
- [x] Verify package added to `package.json`

**Phase 1 Complete** ‚úÖ

## Phase 2: AWS SES Configuration

**Goal:** Set up Amazon Simple Email Service to send emails to info@zdtamusement.com

### 2.1 Create/Access AWS Account
- [ ] Go to https://aws.amazon.com/
- [ ] Sign in or click "Create an AWS Account"
- [ ] If creating new account:
  - [ ] Enter email address and account name
  - [ ] Complete identity verification (credit card required, but SES is pay-as-you-go)
  - [ ] Choose support plan (Basic/Free is fine)

### 2.2 Navigate to SES Console
- [ ] Sign in to AWS Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/
- [ ] Search for "SES" or "Simple Email Service" in top search bar
- [ ] Click "Simple Email Service"
- [ ] **Select your preferred AWS region** (e.g., us-east-1, us-west-2)
  - Note: Record this region - you'll need it in your code

### 2.3 Verify Sender Email Address (info@zdtamusement.com)
- [ ] In SES Console, click "Verified identities" in left sidebar
- [ ] Click "Create identity"
- [ ] Select **Email address**
- [ ] Enter: `info@zdtamusement.com`
- [ ] Click "Create identity"
- [ ] **Check inbox for info@zdtamusement.com**
- [ ] Click verification link in email from Amazon SES
- [ ] Return to SES Console and verify status shows "Verified"

### 2.4 Verify Domain (Optional but Recommended for Production)
- [ ] In SES Console, click "Verified identities"
- [ ] Click "Create identity"
- [ ] Select **Domain**
- [ ] Enter domain: `zdtamusement.com`
- [ ] Choose identity type: **Easy DKIM**
- [ ] Click "Create identity"
- [ ] Copy the 3 CNAME records shown
- [ ] Add these CNAME records to your DNS provider (e.g., Route 53, Cloudflare, GoDaddy)
- [ ] Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours, usually <1 hour)
- [ ] Verify DKIM status shows "Verified" in SES Console

### 2.5 Request Production Access (Move Out of Sandbox)
**Important:** By default, SES is in "Sandbox mode" and can only send to verified addresses. For production, you need to request production access.

- [ ] In SES Console, look for banner about "Sandbox" or navigate to "Account dashboard"
- [ ] Click "Request production access" or similar button
- [ ] Fill out the form:
  - [ ] **Mail Type:** Transactional
  - [ ] **Website URL:** https://zdtamusement.com (or current URL)
  - [ ] **Use case description:**
    ```
    We are implementing a contact form on our business website (ZDT's Adventure Plaza)
    to receive leasing inquiries and general contact requests. Expected volume:
    50-200 emails per month. All emails are user-initiated contact form submissions
    sent to info@zdtamusement.com. We have implemented reCAPTCHA v3 to prevent spam.
    ```
  - [ ] **Process for handling bounces/complaints:**
    ```
    We will monitor the SES console for bounces and complaints. Our contact form
    only sends to our own business email (info@zdtamusement.com), so we have full
    control over the recipient.
    ```
  - [ ] Agree to AWS policies
  - [ ] Submit request
- [ ] Wait for approval (usually within 24 hours, check email)
- [ ] Verify account status changed from "Sandbox" to "Production"

**Note:** While waiting for production access, you can still develop and test by verifying additional test email addresses in Step 2.3.

### 2.6 Create IAM User with SES Permissions
- [ ] In AWS Console, search for "IAM" and open IAM console
- [ ] Click "Users" in left sidebar
- [ ] Click "Create user"
- [ ] Enter username: `ses-smtp-user-zdts`
- [ ] Click "Next"
- [ ] Select "Attach policies directly"
- [ ] Search for and select: **AmazonSESFullAccess** (or create custom policy with only ses:SendEmail)
- [ ] Click "Next"
- [ ] Click "Create user"

### 2.7 Generate SMTP Credentials
- [ ] In SES Console, click "SMTP settings" in left sidebar
- [ ] Click "Create SMTP credentials"
- [ ] Enter IAM User Name: `ses-smtp-user-zdts`
- [ ] Click "Create"
- [ ] **IMPORTANT:** Download or copy credentials:
  - [ ] Copy **SMTP Username**
  - [ ] Copy **SMTP Password**
  - [ ] Save in secure location (you can't view password again)
- [ ] Note the SMTP endpoint shown (e.g., `email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com`)

### 2.8 Add AWS Credentials to Environment Variables
- [ ] Open `.env.local` file
- [ ] Add AWS SES configuration:
  ```bash
  # AWS SES Configuration
  AWS_SES_REGION=us-east-1  # Your selected region
  AWS_SES_SMTP_HOST=email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com  # Your SMTP endpoint
  AWS_SES_SMTP_PORT=465
  AWS_SES_SMTP_USERNAME=your_smtp_username_here
  AWS_SES_SMTP_PASSWORD=your_smtp_password_here
  AWS_SES_FROM_EMAIL=info@zdtamusement.com
  AWS_SES_TO_EMAIL=info@zdtamusement.com
  ```
- [ ] Replace placeholder values with your actual credentials
- [ ] Save the file

### 2.9 Install Email Dependencies
- [ ] Run: `yarn add nodemailer`
- [ ] Run: `yarn add -D @types/nodemailer`
- [ ] Verify packages added to `package.json`

## Notes & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** reCAPTCHA badge not showing
**Solution:** Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY` is set and starts with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`

**Issue:** Emails not sending from local development
**Solution:** Check AWS SES sandbox mode - verify recipient email or request production access

**Issue:** "Invalid login" error from AWS SES
**Solution:** Verify SMTP username/password are correct. Regenerate if needed.

**Issue:** Form submission fails silently
**Solution:** Check browser console for errors. Verify API route returns proper error messages.

**Issue:** Rate limiting blocks legitimate users
**Solution:** Increase rate limit threshold or implement more sophisticated rate limiting (e.g., by user session)

### AWS Cost Monitoring

- **AWS SES Pricing:** $0.10 per 1,000 emails (after free tier)
- **Free Tier:** First 62,000 emails/month are FREE when sent from EC2 or Elastic Beanstalk
- **Expected Cost:** For 200 emails/month = $0.02/month (essentially free)

### reCAPTCHA Score Guidelines

- **1.0:** Very likely a good interaction
- **0.9 - 0.7:** Probably legitimate
- **0.7 - 0.5:** Neutral (still likely human)
- **0.5 - 0.3:** Suspicious
- **0.3 - 0.0:** Very likely a bot

**Recommended threshold:** 0.5 (adjust based on monitoring)

## Migration to AWS (Future)

When you're ready to move hosting from Vercel to AWS:

### AWS Hosting Options
1. **AWS Amplify** - Easiest, similar to Vercel
2. **AWS App Runner** - Container-based, auto-scaling
3. **AWS ECS + Fargate** - More control, Docker containers
4. **AWS EC2 + Load Balancer** - Full control, manual management

### Migration Checklist
- [ ] Choose AWS hosting service
- [ ] Set up Next.js build pipeline
- [ ] Configure environment variables in AWS
- [ ] Update DNS to point to AWS
- [ ] Verify contact form still works
- [ ] (Optional) Switch to AWS SES SDK instead of SMTP for better performance

**The contact form code will work without changes** on AWS because we're using standard Next.js API routes and SMTP (not Vercel-specific features).
